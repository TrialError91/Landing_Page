Final CSS project - The Odin Project - Foundation Course

Final CSS project for the foundation course of the Odin Project curriculum. Not really original on the content for now (a copycat of the base layout): I preferred to dedicate my effort towards the application and understanding of the concepts taught in the course up to now. Definetely looking forward to expand on it later on with a more advanced knowledge of HTML and CSS plus some javascript.
